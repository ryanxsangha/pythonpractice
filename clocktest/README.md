# CLOCKTEST

### Description

Using the time package from python alongside tkinder, this program extrapolates real time data to portray the current time in PST.

Upon execution, the program creates a new window with specific parameters to display the current time in the form of a clock. The parameters speicify the title of the window (Ryan's Clock), format of window (Hours : Minutes : Seconds), standard of the time portrayed (PST), as well as various text formatters (font, size, background and foreground colors). Once the program gathers this information, the main loop is run infinitely as the clock is constantly updating in realtime and will be killed upon exiting the window.
